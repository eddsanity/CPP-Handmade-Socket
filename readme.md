# Handmade Socket
Handmade Socket is a hobby sub-project that abstracts C-sockets. It is intended to be cross-platform and multithreaded, 
but right now it only supports windows and is single threaded.

# Why?
I am working on a Handmade C++ RESTful SDK and I needed a socket abstraction to help me build it without losing my sanity dealing with C-Sockets.

# Dependencies
## Windows
